BootMyComputer
==============

I wrote this app to SSH into a raspberry pi on my LAN and send a wakeonlan packet to my desktop, however with little modification it could be used to issue any remote ssh command from any voice trigger.  I am using [sshj](https://github.com/shikhar/sshj) as my ssh library.
