===============

I wrote this little app to SSH into my router and either send a wakeonlan packet to my desktop, or ssh in and shut it down.  With little modification it could be used to issue any remote ssh command from any voice trigger.  I am using [sshj](https://github.com/shikhar/sshj) as my ssh library.
